# IDEAS

- abstract & simple map

- item that freezes projectiles
- block zapper
- (for traps) magic milk
- popup tower arrow (like avm)
- player shuffle (with someone from your own team?)
- player locator
- bundles
- rocket that launches you up
- portable enderchest?
- shulker box
- flint and steel
- instant bed protection. can be placed near a bed to cover it with basic protection
- unignited tnt
- bed mover. moves a bed up to 5 blocks. might have to be anounced globally and only be usable once per team.

- sudden death
- disable the locator bar
- show your teamates position on the locator bar
- map specific bed blocks?
- countdown when starting the game

- seperate the default content from the game itself
- documentation of apis

- make the team chest locked (i don't know if it is possible)
- dialogs instead of villagers for shops
