# How To Play

(These steps are subject to change)

> Note: this datapack will DELETE an area around 0 0

1. Get the latest version of the datapack either from the [releases section](https://github.com/JuNi4/Bedwars/releases/latest) or directly from the source.
2. Create a world with no blocks in it by using the 'Super Flat' preset 'The Void' (or don't if you want scenery around the map).
3. Either add the datapack in the world creation screen or afterwards to the world/datapack folder. This is also where you should add any addons (you can also do so later, just remember to run `/reload` every time you add one).
4. You need to have a simulation distance of at least 16 chunks.
5. There has to be at least one other person with you in the world.
6. Run the command `/function bedwars:setup` to set up the datapack. This has to be run once per world or if the datapack updated.
7. Select how many teams you want to have by clicking on the command block in the lobby that is labeled "Settings" or running the command `/function bedwars:settings`. This will bring up a menu where you can choose the amount of teams.
8. Start the game by pressing the start button on the spawn platform.
9. Play the game until it ends, or if you decide to end it early, run the command `/function bedwars:reset` to reset everything and have the game ready for another round. If the round ends by itself (time ran out or a team won) this will be executed after 10 seconds automatically.
10. Once the game is over, all of you will be teleported back to the start paltform. You can't start the game while the reset is in progress. Wait until it is done and press the start button to start the game again.


## Bedrock Edition

The only way to play with this datapack on Bedrock is to host a server with a plugin like [Geyser](https://geysermc.org/) that allows Bedrock players to join a Java server.
Playing on bedrock edition will cause some items to not appear correctly as item components are not available on bedrock edition. The items however, will still function like they normally would.
